# PKT VPN
The PKT VPN is built to connect to, send and receive traffic through the cjdns network. PKT VPN enables users to get a base-line VPN for free, and pay for speed using microtransactions with PKT Cash. 

VPN server administrators will register as a public PKT VPN, accept client connections and route VPN traffic through the PKT network. Users can browse a list of VPNs, select the best VPN based on location and bandwidth load and surf the internet from behind a PKT VPN exit node. VPN creates utility for the PKT Network and offers financial incentive in addition to PKT Cash mining.
