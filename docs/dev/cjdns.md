# Cjdns
PKT is an ideological continuation of the cjdns mesh networking project, launched by PKT Lead Developer Caleb James DeLisle in 2011. Cjdns solves several weaknesses with internet function, such as data privacy, need for decentralization and optimized, efficient routing. 

Cjdns provides anyone with an IPv6 address, which is the basis for a global mesh network in which anyone can share their internet and become an internet service provider.
