PacketCrypt is the worldâ€™s first bandwidth-hard proof of work. Packet = Bandwidth and Crypt = Encryption. This technology incentivizes miners to increase bandwidth upload & download throughput. PKT mining favors increased bandwidth over CPU power, rewarding people that connect high speed bandwidth infrastructure to the PKT Network.
