# TokenStrike
TokenStrike is a unique protocol for the issuance and exchange of tokens and NFTs inside of the PKT ecosystem. TokenStrike is designed for micro-transactions, so tokens must be issued and exchanged with zero cost and without gas fees (gas fees for the exchange of ERC-20 tokens is unacceptable). 

TokenStrike tokens can be exchanged in a fully untrusted Lightning Network HTLC transaction. This is a scalable solution that fosters unlimited marketplace potential, including a decentralized bandwidth market, and sets PKT apart from every other layer 1 blockchain in the world.

Edge Points will tokenize their bandwidth using TokenStrike and sell tokenized bandwidth to Cloud ISPs to broker connectivity to real customers. This collectively will interface with PKT VPN and evolve to facilitate software defined networking and content delivery across the internet.
