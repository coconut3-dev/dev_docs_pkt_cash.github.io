## Wallet setup
There are several wallets which you can choose from, the easiest to set up are

* [PKT Electrum](./electrum) which has a Graphical UI and supports Windows, Mac and Linux.
* [PKT Wallet](./pktwalletgui) which has a Graphical UI and supports MacOS and works great with miners.
* [Pkt.world Wallet](https://www.pkt.world/wallet) which has a Graphical UI for Windows, works with miners and includes a built-in miner.

You can also setup [PKT Wallet](./pktd/pktwallet) which is command line only but has greater
scalability and privacy features.
## Mining
PKT is mined using the PacketCrypt bandwidth hard mining algorithm. You can learn how
to mine on the [Mining](./mining) page.
## Running a pktd instance
You can setup a pktd instance using the instructions on [pktd](./pktd).
