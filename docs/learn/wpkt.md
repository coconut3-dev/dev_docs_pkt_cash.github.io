# What is WPKT?
WPKT stands for wrapped PKT, thus the "W" in WPKT. WPKT exists on Binance Smart Chain blockchain. WPKT can only come into existence when someone sends PKT to the vault address, which converts the PKT into WPKT. As such, WPKT cannot be inflated since it has a 1-to-1 peg with PKT. Since there will only ever be 6 billion PKT in existence, there can never be more WPKT than the total amount of PKT in existence. WPKT is an BEP-20 token and is compatible with all platforms and wallets that accept and transact with the BEP-20 token standard.
